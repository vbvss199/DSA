ok buddy homework is to get gud at flutter.

grind some leetcodes and when you get bored with basic language features, 
move to flutter and learn Cubit (a lightweight version of Bloc) and basic Stateful Widgets using setState()

recommend making your own project and then figure out how to fetch & show random trump tweets or some bullshit with those state management tools.


Fluteer (cubit):
just like javascript for the react=> dart for the flutter 
WIDGETS : which are the building blocks of Flutter app's User Interface .
